# Haxball-A-multiplayer-online-football-game
Instructions to run the server on your computer: 
> Create a folder where you want all the game files to be. Say “Haxball” Inside Haxball, create another folder called public. Dump the html, Script and Styles.css Files there. Outside the public folder, dump server.js. Now run <npm init -y> , <npm install express socket.io>, node server.js. Expected outcome is “Game running on PORT abcd”. To now actually play, on both computers open <serverRunnerIP>:<port>
